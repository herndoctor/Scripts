# Scripts

Mimigatoz.bat

A quick batch file (.bat) to minidump (with mimikatz) all .dmp files in the current directory automatically. The .dmp files should be named uniquely. Results will be written to an 'output.txt' file and dumped .dmp files will be added to a 'DUMPED' folder (created upon initial execution). Additional dumps will be appended to the 'output.txt' file and also added to the existing 'DUMPED' folder for tracking.
